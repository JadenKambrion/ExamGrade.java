Hey! This is my first coding project utilizing Java! 
I asked the user to enter the marks scored by a student for each of the 5 examinations. The maximum score could be 100. Once the user has entered all the scores I displayed the sum of all the scores, percentage of the scores and the grade. The grade was determined by the following criteria.

If the percentage of the total marks scored is 90 or greater, the grade is A.
If the percentage of the total marks scored is 80 or greater but less than 90, the grade is B.
If the percentage of the total marks scored is 70 or greater but less than 80, the grade is C.
If the percentage of the total marks scored is 60 or greater but less than 70, the grade is D.
If the percentage of the total marks scored is less than 60, the grade is F.

The Output is as follows:
You are going to enter marks for the five exams. For each of the exams the max marks could be 100
How many marks did you score in the first exam:100.
How many marks did you score in the second exam:90.
How many marks did you score in the third exam:80.
How many marks did you score in the fourth exam:87.
How many marks did you score in fifth exam:93.
The total of your marks:450
The total percentage of your marks:90
You got an A
